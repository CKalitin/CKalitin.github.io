### Transition from Privately Owned ICE vehicles to Autonomous Robotaxis
1. S-curves (show them, and why they're the future) "S-curves are destiny"
2. Personal arguments do not matter, economics does
3. Implications (less car ownership, new auotmotive market decreases, majority of income from software, first mover advantage?, bankruptcies, adjacent technologies, other transport methods that can't compete, clean future)
4. Kurzweil quote about applying paradigms

### The Rocket Lab Master Plan
1. Bro Q3 report just came out they're actually doing so well its crazy im hyped

### Stoke's Path to Profitability and Market Dominance
1. Show the intermediary steps
2. Show why Terran 1/ABL comparisons aren't valid (There's a market, they are making technical progress, respectively)
3. Show the three stages of Nova (Prototype LEO launches, Price competitiveness with MLVs, niche launcher in fully reusable land)

### Nova cost model
1. It isn't gonna be perfect, but the shapes of the graphs should be right
2. If it's right on the edge of working, assume it won't
3. Just make the model and write about the assumptions and conclusions

### Have Launch Costs Actually Decreased?
1. Peter Lionnet on Payload talked about this
2. Soyuz, Ariane, Delta/Atlas, Falcon
3. https://x.com/TheRTest/status/1860547305776066782
4. This too: https://x.com/TheRTest/status/1860553566185763069 - Kourou launched Soyuz was pricier?

### Breakdown of Launch & Payload Data
1. Just summarize all of my charts
2. Make more too!
3. Explain the insights from all of them
 - This is seemed that seems too obvious to do, so it's even more important

### What Actually is the Market for Earth Observation Satellites?
1. I actually don't know why the data is useful?
2. Is this an anecdote situation?

### When Will Synthetic CH4 Be Economical?
1. Just think about it
