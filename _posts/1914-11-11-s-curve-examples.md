Ideas:
1. Show the charts on historic S curves that I have
2. Define S curve
3. Give overview on why it happens
4. Learning Rate!!
5. Why does it level off?

Structure:
Section 1:
1. Define s curve briefly
2. Show all historic s curves
3. Explain why these are so powerful
Section 2:
4. Learning Rate is why they happen
5. Give examples of learning rate from the past and today
Section 3:
6. Conclude with predcitions

I've decided I'm going to be an <a href="https://x.com/Andercot/status/1855046549015052624">Econophysicist</a>.

What is an S-curve?
An s curve (sigmoid curve) is a specific shape of a graph of market share vs. time.
- Sigmoid etymology

The four stages of the S-curve:
1. Early R&D
2. Initial Commercial Appeal
3. Obvious exponential growth
4. Market Saturation
5. Stagnation

- This list looks very similar to the one from The Singularity Is Near
Precursor stage: dreaming, eg. Da Vinci drawing aeroplanes
Invention stage: the birth of a technology
Development stage: often more crucial than invention, many improvements that may be more important than the original invention
Maturity stage: interwoven into the fabric of life
Stage of the false pretenders: upstart threatens to replace the technology, but is missing some element, fails to surpass the original invention, short victory for the original technology 
Final stage: new technology renders the original technology into a stage of obsolescence
Actual final stage: The complete end of the original invention, eg. horse and buggy, records

- Mention that Growth rates exponentially decline, with the image example of EVs

The early growth of a technology is characterized by exponential improvements that do not make much of an impact for its total market share. The technology may be exponentially improving, but it is still not good enough for anyone to use it at scale. 
- There's a storage example here (silicon or something? SSDs?)

After this initial R&D phase, there is a smooth transition to a phase in which the technology begins to be adopted. It has exponentially declined in cost enough that it has its own niche. An example here is golf carts, they are a relatively small and niche market compared to all other vehicles, but it just so happens that the electric powertrain is more optimal for the user experience than an internal combustion engine.

- Casey Handmer Clip: https://youtu.be/ekEdq6PhC0Q?si=3AEwnx4ETjwbmKmI&t=541 on how to actually understand Moore's Law, why does it happen really? I still can't write the full proof.

What to cover:
1. Explain what an S-curve is
2. Show my charts
3. Explain how to use S curves to predict the future
4. Show my EV prediction
5. Describe the 5 stages of an S curve, then show Kurzweil's 7 stages
6. Explain Learning Rate <- Casey Handmer Clip
7. Show that growth rate linearly declines, derivative magic means a nice smooth exponential looking curve
