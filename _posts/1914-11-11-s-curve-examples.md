Ideas:
1. Show the charts on historic S curves that I have
2. Define S curve
3. Give overview on why it happens
4. Learning Rate!!
5. Why does it level off?

Structure:
Section 1:
1. Define s curve briefly
2. Show all historic s curves
3. Explain why these are so powerful
Section 2:
4. Learning Rate is why they happen
5. Give examples of learning rate from the past and today
Section 3:
6. Conclude with predcitions

I've decided I'm going to be an <a href="pls link me to that reply to casey handmer">Econophysicists<\a>.

What is an S-curve?
An s curve (sigmoid curve) is a specific shape of a graph of market share vs. time.
- Sigmoid etymology

The four stages of the S-curve:
1. Early R&D
2. Initial Commercial Appeal
3. Obvious exponential growth
4. Market Saturation
5. Stagnation
- This list looks very similar to the one from The Singularity Is Near

- Mention that Growth rates exponentially decline

The early growth of a technology is characterized by exponential improvements that do not make much of an impact for its total market share. The technology may be exponentially improving, but it is still not good enough for anyone to use it at scale. 
- There's a storage example here (silicon or something? SSDs?)

After this initial R&D phase, there is a smooth transition to a phase in which the technology begins to be adopted. It has exponentially declined in cost enough that it has its own niche. An example here is golf carts, they are a relatively small and niche market compared to all other vehicles, but it just so happens that the electric powertrain is more optimal for the user experience than an internal combustion engine.
