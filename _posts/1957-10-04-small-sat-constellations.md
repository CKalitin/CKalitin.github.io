What to cover:
1. List small sat constellations and how many rideshare (many)
2. Is there a large enough market for 1 ton class vehicles?
3. Dedicated launch is only for small constellations that need high revisit rates (eg. not RF situational awareness)

* Will the industry converage to hosted payloads on common satellite buses?

Conclusion: bullish on electron short term until vehicles like Nova can compete but at that time we'll be entering a different paradigm where hosted payloads are more common so from a Rocket Lab perspective, Neutron and Space Systems take over.

### <b>Which Constellations Require Dedicated Launches?</b>

Constellations that have a relatively small number of satellites and require high & regular revisit rates are well suited for dedicated launches. Many of the recent Synthetic Aperture Radar constellations fall into this category such as Capella, iQPS, Synspective, and Black Sky. These constellations benefit from high & regular revisit rates so they can provide near real-time data to their customers and cover specific parts of the Earth regularly (eg. once every half hour). 

Recently there's been a great example of the Commercial benefit that dedicated launches provide: <a href="https://synspective.com/press-release/2024/launch-agreement-rocketlab/">Synspective signed a 10 launch deal with Rocket Lab</a>. Given an Electron average sales price of $8M, this is a $80M contract. The cost of a SpaceX rideshare mission is an <a href="https://www.spacex.com/rideshare/">initial charge of $300k for 50kg to SSO with each additional kilogram at $6k</a>. Assuming Synspective launches 2 100kg Strix satellites per Electron this is 20 satellites in total. On SpaceX rideshare missions this would cost $12M, a $68M cost delta. 

Launch schedule is another factor to consider when analysing Synspective's choice to go with Rocket Lab. The Electron launches will occur between 2025 and 2027. SpaceX rideshare missions are rumoured to be booked 2 years out and they launch 3-5 times per year (Up to 5 with Bandwagon rideshare missions). Assuming a start date in 2026, Completing 10 launches for Synspective could take SpaceX until 2028 or 2029. Even assuming the schedule issue is resolved with higher scale in the future, rideshare missions still mean suboptimal orbits.

The cost advantage of rideshare missions is cancelled out by the schedule (temporary) and orbit/delivery (premanent) disadvantages. One of the primary disadvantage of rideshare missions is having to negotiate with several other companies on which orbit the satellites will be deployed into. This means every customer is not where they want to be. This on top of the schedule disadvantage means each satellite is initially producing less revenue than it otherwise could be. In the case of Synspective, the advantage of launching on Electron appears to be worth at least $3.4M.

Prefire and Tropics do not fall into the category laid out above because they are made of 2 & 4 satellites respectively and will not be expanded in the future. Unlike commercial constellations, these are one-off NASA contellations that serve a very narrow and specific Earth Observation purpose and there will not be an increase in demand for the data these satellites provide. When new data is needed, NASA will develop and launch a new set of 2-10 satellites.

### <b>The Case for Rideshare Missions Launching Constellations</b>

Two categories: Large constellations, small constellations with more propulsion

Kick stages like Impulse's Mira can't solve this problem in the future because they cannot 
* You can shift orbital plane with a slightly higher orbit and RAAN change when in SSO.
* More propulsion might be needed, good anyway like Starlink sats boosting themselves (higher isp!)

* Earth Observation launches can be done on rideshare but when scaling the constellation, deciated launches provide an advantage

The first category of Small Satellite Constellations that launch on rideshare missions are those with such high scale that the exact orbits of dedicated launches are not required. These include Planet Labs, Spire Global, and Swarm (before SpaceX acquired them). 

The second category is constellations that don't require the revisit rate benefit of dedicated launches (even spacing of orbital planes). HawkEye 360 is the best example of this as this is one of the few constellations that is not focused on Earth Observation or communication with Earth-based assets. They sell Radio Frequency signal location data. This process involves detecting RF emmissions and triangulating the source with multiple satellite passes over the same location. This means the orbit requirements are not as strict as other constellations. In contrast to the Synspective example in the previous section, HawkEye 360 does not get as much direct monetary benefit from dedicated launches.
