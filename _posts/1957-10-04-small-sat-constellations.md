What to cover:
1. List small sat constellations and how many rideshare (many)
2. Is there a large enough market for 1 ton class vehicles?
3. Dedicated launch is only for small constellations that need high revisit rates (eg. not RF situational awareness)

* Will the industry converage to hosted payloads on common satellite buses?

Conclusion: bullish on electron short term until vehicles like Nova can compete but at that time we'll be entering a different paradigm where hosted payloads are more common so from a Rocket Lab perspective, Neutron and Space Systems take over.

### <b>Which Constellations Require Dedicated Launches</b>
Small constellations that require high and regular revisit rates
iQPS electron launch contract?

The constellations that require dedicated launches are those that have a relatively small number of satellites and require high & regular revisit rates. Many of the recent Synthetic Aperture Radar constellations fall into this category such as Capella, iQPS, Synspective, and Black Sky. These constellations benefit from high & regular revisit rates so they can provide near real-time data to their customers and cover specific parts of the Earth regularly (eg. once every half hour). 

Recently there's been a great example of the Commercial benefit that dedicated launches provide: <a href="https://synspective.com/press-release/2024/launch-agreement-rocketlab/">Synspective signed a 10 launch deal with Rocket Lab</a>. Given an Electron average sales price of $8M, this is a $80M contract. The cost of a SpaceX rideshare mission is an <a href="https://www.spacex.com/rideshare/">initial charge of $300k for 50kg with each additional kilogram at $6k/kg</a>. Assuming Synspective launches 2 100kg Strix satellites per Electron this is 20 satellites in total. On SpaceX rideshare missions this would cost $12M, a $68M delta. 

Launch schedule is another factor to consider when analysing Synspective's choice to go with Rocket Lab. The Rocket Lab launches will occur between 2025 and 2027. SpaceX rideshare missions are rumoured to be booked 2 years out and they launch 3-5 times per year (Up to 5 with Bandwagon rideshare missions). Assuming a start date in 2026, Completing 10 launches for Synspective could take SpaceX until 2028 or 2029. Even assuming the schedule issue is resolved with scale in the future, rideshare missions still mean suboptimal orbits.

The cost advantage of rideshare missions is cancelled out by the schedule (temporary) and orbit (premanent) disadvantages. The primary disadvantage of rideshare missions is having to negotiate with several other companies on which orbit the satellites will be deployed into. This means every customer is not where they want to be. This on top of the schedule disadvantage means each satellite is producing less revenue than it otherwise could be. In the case of Synspective, the advantage of launch on Electron appears to be worth at least $3.4M.

Prefire and Tropics do not fall into the category laid out above because they are made of 2 & 4 satellites respectively and will not be expanded in the future. Unlike commercial constellations, these are one-off NASA contellations that serve a very narrow and specific Earth Observation purpose. Unlike Commerical Earth Observation data, there will not be an increase in demand for the data these satellites provide. When new data is needed, NASA will develop and launch a new set 2-10 of satellites.

### <b>The Case for Rideshare Missions Launching Constellations</b>

Kick stages like Impulse's Mira can't solve this problem in the future because they cannot 
* You can shift orbital plane with a slightly higher orbit and RAAN change when in SSO.
* More propulsion might be needed, good anyway like Starlink sats boosting themselves (higher isp!)

* Earth Observation launches can be done on rideshare but when scaling the constellation, deciated launches provide an advantage
