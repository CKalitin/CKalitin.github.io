This is a demand analysis.

At first glance, Stoke's Nova appears to be an immensely exciting R&D project without much commercial appeal. In a world where the currently most successful rocket (and throughout history) is a 20 ton class partially reusable launch vehicle, it is difficult to see exactly how such a comparativly small rocket will compete. Data is the answer to all your problems, so I've answered all my questions with my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOgRbnAsQZdGIPoemRj5ApSLk_jxGanNliWEPnBB3p4/edit?usp=sharing">dataset</a> on successful western orbital launches from 2018-2023 inclusive and will convey all insights in this blog post.

Stoke's Nova rocket is perfectly sized to compete for existing satellite launches and future constellations. It can compete for LEO satellite launches as the average mass of customer payloads on Falcon 9 is 4.4 tons (ex. Dragon). Furthermore, full reusability allows Nova to launch constellations even with its 5t LEO capacity. The launch cost must be several times lower than competitors and reusability allows for this. Finally, the fully reusable architecture lends itself to becoming a cargo/crew capsule and refilling in orbit to address high energy orbits and potentially Moon/Mars landings.

### <b>Full Reusability Makes Constellations Addressable</b>

1. Current competition is partially reusable, (downrange vs. RTLS, ie. size)
2. Constellations can be launched on any size of rocket (Neutron Vs. New Glenn)
3. Nova is 4x smaller than F9, so will have to launch 4x+ cheaper, possible through full reusability

Structure V3:
1. Launching Constellations (launching more, but cheaper)
2. Small size is a feature (flight rate decreases cost, lower upfront development cost, full reusability required to achieve low cost eg. Firefly)
3. Competing against partially-reusable launch vehicles
4. Competing against fully-reusable launch vehicles
5. Stoke is a well suited organizations (SpaceX example, Rocket Lab might not have been able to do this)

+ Constellations:

Through following current trends in the launch market, it is clear launching constellations is what almost all new rockets should be optimized for. 67% of commercial payloads launched in the last 6 years were for constellations. 80% of these launches were Starlink while the remaining is comprised mainly of Iridium and OneWeb. With numerous upcoming constellations, mainly Kuiper, it is clear this market will experience much more rapid growth than other payload types.

Excluding Starlink, the market for commercial launches is shared in equal thirds between Constellations, GEO Communications Satellites, and Small Satellite launches. Legacy GEO Communications satellites are a fairly static market and have been for ~20 years. Small satellites are experiencing exponential growth, but the TAM for rideshare missions is relatively low. This leaves constellations as the massive market that is exponentailly growing.

The primary considerations behind selecting a launch provider for a constellations are responsiveness and cost per launch per satellite. Constellations can be launched on rockets of almost any size because they are made up of a large number of relatively small satellites. To illustrate this, a 20 ton class mediun-lift launch vehicle is not required to launch constellations. A 5 ton class rocket can be competitive if cost is 4x less and cadence is 4x more than the 20 ton class vehicle. Furthermore, the requirement for an increased number of launches to be competitive potentially gives advantages in responsiveness.

Launching constellations has very different considerations from the legacy satellite market. The legacy market consists of large GEO communications satellites and some (mainly government) satellites in low Earth orbit. This market consists of around two dozen launches per year and mass to LEO is a major consideration, especially for GEO satellites. Launching constellations, you do not have the same requirements for minimum mass to orbit. The factors to aim for in launching constellations are flight-rate and cost per launch per satellite. The a low cost per launch per satellite can be achieved almost at any scale.

Stoke's Nova is designed to launch about 5 tons (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/09/stoke-space-hops-its-upper-stage-leaping-toward-a-fully-reusable-rocket/">7t according to Eric Berger</a>). At this scale, to be competitive with Falcon 9 it must be 4x cheaper per launch. With would be $15M to the customer, or a <a href="https://youtu.be/DxREm3s1scA?si=ejdsalwfZkgcCpZG&t=2360">~$4M marginal launch cost</a>. With full reusability this is achieveable. From my perspective, it even appears more achievable than Neutron achieving lower marginal launch costs than Falcon 9.

+ High flight rate is a feature / Small size is a feature:

Nova needing to launch 4x as much as Falcon 9 to put the same mass into orbit is a feature. Flight rate appears to be the determining factor behind falling launch costs apart from vehicle architecture. Launching 4x as much as your competitors with a smaller fully-reusable vehicle allows for an accelerated process of lowering costs. Contrast this with Neutron, which will likely launch less than Falcon 9 with a second stage of <a href="https://x.com/BellikOzan/status/1741535515759857816?s=20">similar complexity</a>. It will be much harder for Rocket Lab to compete with Falcon 9 than Stoke.

+ Competeing against partially-reusable launch vehicles:

Nova's scale makes it very well suited to competing with Neutron. First, the average mass of customer payloads on Falcon 9 is 4.4t (exluding Dragon). This is addressable both by Nova and Neutron. Second, the next largest market for Falcon 9 is GEO communications satellites. Neutron GTO capacity is rumored to be around 3-5 tons. Because Nova is planned to be refilled in orbit, its GEO capacity will be the same as LEO capacity, 5 tons. Finally, both rockets will compete for launching constellations and as mentioned above, Nova is positioned to cost less than Neutron long-term.

+ Competeing against larger fully-reusable launch vehicles:

Because of the larger sizes of New Glenn and Terran R, they may be in less competition with Nova than Neutron. These rockets are much larger which allows them to launch the heaviest GEO satellites and pursue difficult markets like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Moon_(spacecraft)">HLS</a>. Furthermore, these vehicles have upgrade paths to full reusability.

Stoke's Nova is clearly an excellent architecture to compete against partially-reusable launch vehicles, but it is far less clear Stoke's position against larger fully and rapidly reusable launch vehicles. 
1. Small sat launcher
2. Starship's too big
3. It might serve smaller constellations (eg. Iridium, OneWeb, Intelsat)
4. Legacy Market

+ Why hasn't this been done before / Well suited organization:

Current and upcoming rockets that are aiming to launch constellations are all partially reusable medium-lift launch vehicles (excluding Starship, I'll cover that later). A partially-reusable rocket is the most reasonable thing for a slightly risk-averse company to do. For companies like Rocket Lab or ULA, it is very difficult to pursue a fully and rapidly reusable rocket. This is an unproven market and it has never been done before and is a very hard sell to investors. This is especially true when you consider the development cost of such a program: ~$250M for Neutron vs. ~$5B for Starship. It takes a level of audacity to push for such a program that will create its own market. SpaceX has done this again and again with Falcon 9, Starlink, and now Starship & Mars.
