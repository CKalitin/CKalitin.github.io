1. Dedicated Small Sat Launch
2. NSSL
3. Constellations
4. High flight rate = lower costs
5. Commercial Payloads
6. Capsule (Crew / Cargo, mostly cargo)
7. Predictions
8. Stoke might die brutally (Astra)

Structure:
1. Opening (stoke can address almost all current market segments and full reusability matters, a rocket like Nova)
2. Existing LEO Satellites (4.4t)
3. Constellations (Fully Reusability)
4. GEO Communication Satellites (compete against F9+Helios)
4. Capsule (Cargo, slim chance of crew)
5. Moon Lander
6. NSSL capability (demonstrate power of refilling in orbit)

Structure V2:
1. Opening
2. Fully reusability allows addressing almost all markets (Constellations, Small Sats, GEO)
3. Future addressable markets on Nova platform (Capsule, Moon, NSSL)
4. Implications for existing rockets (No one is as smart as me)
5. Conclusion (work into above section?)

Stoke's Nova rocket is perfectly sized to compete for existing satellite launches and future constellations. It can compete for LEO satellite launches as the average mass of customer payloads on Falcon 9 is 4.4 tons (ex. Dragon). Furthermore, full reusability allows Nova to launch constellations even with its 5t LEO capacity. The launch cost must be several times lower than competitors and reusability allows for this. Finally, the fully reusable architecture lends itself to becoming a cargo/crew capsule and refilling in orbit to address high energy orbits and potentially Moon/Mars landings.

### <b>Full Reusability Makes Constellations Addressable</b>

At first glance, Stoke's Nova appears to be an immensely exciting R&D project without much commercial appeal. In a world where a medium-lift partially reusable launch vehicle is the most successful rocket in history, it is difficult to see how such a comparitevly small rocket will compete.
