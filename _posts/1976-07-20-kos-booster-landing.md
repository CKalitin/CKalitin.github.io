Tell me where I'm wrong or just give compliments <a href="https://x.com/CKalitin/status/1810414736376549594">here</a>.

One of the reasons Casey Handmer cites when telling people to write blogs is that they are proof of work. Many of my early projects will not be impressive at all, but it's worth documenting it for a few reasons. (1) To share my thought process throughout the project. (2) To force myself into documenting it. (3) To be able to reflect in the future. Forcing yourself to document something means it's much harder to be satisfied with the shitty way of solving a problem. This is why everyone should write a blog.
