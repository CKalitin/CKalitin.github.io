Tell me where I'm wrong or just give compliments <a href="https://x.com/CKalitin/status/1810414736376549594">here</a>.

Casey Handmer's reasoning on why you should start a blog is that it's proof of work. Many of my early projects will not be impressive at all, but it's worth documenting it for a few reasons. (1) To share my thought process throughout the project. (2) To force myself into documenting it. (3) To be able to reflect in the future. Also, this is why everyone should write a blog. Forcing yourself to document something means it's much harder to be satisfied with the shitty way of solving a problem.
