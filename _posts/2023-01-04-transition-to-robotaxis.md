# Transition from Privately Owned ICE vehicles to Autonomous Robotaxis
1. S-curves (show them, and why they're the future) "S-curves are destiny"
2. Personal arguments do not matter, economics does
3. Implications (less car ownership, new auotmotive market decreases, majority of income from software, first mover advantage?, bankruptcies, adjacent technologies, other transport methods that can't compete, clean future)
4. Kurzweil quote about applying paradigms

1. EV revolution (S-curves, declining costs, Cross over point, Graphs, companies, etc.)
2. Autonomous revolution (Predicting pace of AI, adoption in new vehicles (OEMs), retrofitting, potential first mover advantage, etc.)



The automotive market is currenting undergoing a transition from privately owned internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to autonomous EV robotaxis. 

There are three components to this transition: ICE to EV, Manual to Autonomous, and Privately owned vehicles to Robotaxis.

The transition to EVs is occuring due to simply explained economic reasons. The transition to autonomy will occur maining due to leasure and safety reasons from the consumer's perspective. The final transition from privately owned vehicles to robotaxis will occur due to the improved ease of use of Robotaxis.

"S-curves are like gravity" - Tony Seba. These transitions can be seen to be as likely as the sun rising tomorrow. Almost every society-level problem is an economics problem, and economic predictions can be immensely accurate.

### EV Revolution

1. S-curves
2. Extrapolating S-curves
3. Fundamental Technologies and their explonential decline in cost
4. EVs are cheaper to own and operate than ICE vehicles
5. 

Currently, the EV revolution is occuring at fervent pace. This is occuring in the segment of personally owned vehicles and in the commercial vehicle segment (Heavy vehicles, commerically owned vehicles, etc.)

It appears growth in EV adoption has peaked in 2014 and has been sporadically declining since. This is the be expected and is visible in many other <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSFc0gy2LnJKCwSEu2trwpLwnUNQqv1Y0znnX72tie8/edit?usp=sharing">S-Curves</a>. As any technology matures and the market becomes saturated, growth slowes. The decline in growth is not an indictment of the technology, but rather a sign of its maturity. The slow in growth serves to help you identify when the technology will reach its peak market share, which in almost all cases is >99%.

Ark Invest published <a href="https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/ev-growth-outperforming-the-traditional-s-curve-dynamics/">this article</a> featuring an S-Curve with market share and percentage growth meeting at the 50% mark. This is an oversimplification or simply incorrect. Growth peaks at 5%-10% <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSFc0gy2LnJKCwSEu2trwpLwnUNQqv1Y0znnX72tie8/edit?usp=sharing">(see here)</a>.

Almost all the major internal components of EVs are declining in cost. 

This is most obvious in the cost of the battery. Batteries have been on a declining cost curve for almost all time. This is due to advancements in materials science, battery chemistry, and economies of scale.

### Autonomous Revolution

The autonomus part of this revolution is currently occuring at a slower pace than the transition to EVs. At any given moment there are <10,000 autonomous vehicles (AVs) driving on roads, even at the most quite hour of night there are many orders of magnitude more EVs driving. This is due to the fact that the AV S-curve is 5-10 years behind the EV revolution. S-curve growth peaks at around  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSFc0gy2LnJKCwSEu2trwpLwnUNQqv1Y0znnX72tie8/edit?usp=sharing">5% - 10% market share</a>. AVs are not yet at a point for clear exponential growth while EVs are.
