title: "Applying the Law of Accelerating Returns"

I’ve read a few of George Hotz’s blog posts. So I’m starting a blog.
This is a first, late-night, attempt at a blog post.

In predicting any part of the future, I aim to be as accurate as possible. Emotions are the antithesis of this, emotions are not accurate. Predicting the future of humanity has nothing to do with my optimism or pessimism about it. I want to be right.

I do not solely aim to spend my life predicting what others build, but before you can build the future you have to know what to build. Kurzweil says it well, “As an inventor in the 1970s, I began to realise that my inventions needed to make sense in terms of the enabling technologies and market forces that would exist when the invention was introduced as that would be a very different one from the one in which the way was conceived.” 

The Law of Accelerating Returns is the most fundamental aspect of technology that everyone needs to understand. I have seen friends say “we won’t have electric trucks for 20 years” or “AI cannot take over the world”. These points fundamentally misunderstand the exponential growth of new paradigms, the S-curve. Furthermore, these points miss the exponentially increasing growth rate of humanity, see the energy chart. Humans are bad at understanding exponentials.
