title: "NASA's fucked - Here's my vision"
#categories: misc

Hopefully writing these blog posts makes me smarter and doesn't purely put my partly correct ideas on the internet.

Todo:
1. Constellation becoming SLS (fucked)
2. Cost plus
3. Origin of cost-plus (ww2, cost-plus was fine in Apollo era)
4. How did no one see this? Laziness? Worden & Musk?
5. Shut down the education department - Aside on Ramaswamy and budgeting

How to fix it:
1. One customer of many
2. Commercialize Space (inevitable either way)
3. What's the goal? I thought it was science, not a jobs program
4. Build platforms for science (CLPS)

Sections:
1. How'd this happen? (origin of cost plus and how it evolved)
2. How fix? (Make the goal science)

## How'd This Happen?

In reseraching NASA I have come to the obivous conclusion that it is a horribly beauricratic and political organizaiton. I haven't seen anyone ardently dispute this point.
As I am writing this post I see the Moon rising over the horizon. NASA has failed. We haven't colonized it yet.

How do a few kilograms of mars rocks cost $10B?
How tf does the SLS cost $20B before its first flight?

There's two core explanations: 
1. Cost-Plus contracting
2. Politics

Cost-Plus contracting gained a lot of popularity during the Second World War. The government needed to build a lot of stuff quickly and cost-plus was the best way to do it. Your company gives an estimated price for a contract. If you need more money, oh well, we're at war, you can have it. No one would dare over spend money if your coworker's son would die.

No one dies if SLS is delayed 5 years. So Boeing can just keep asking for more money. And they do. And they get it. And they're still not done.


The other explanation is politics. 

First, I will focus on the Senate Launch System (SLS) and Artemis Program. 
It was born out of the constellation program. Ozan Belick post's have a lot of good info on this. https://ozanbellik.blogspot.com/2021/11/whatever-happened-to-single-launch.html

The Constellation Program's plan to land on the moon involved two launches that docked in Low Earth Orbit.
1. An Ares 1 launches an Orion capsule into orbit
2. An Ares 5 launches a lander and a TLI stage.

When Constellation was rightly cancelled by the Obama Administration in favour of Commerical Space (lots of info about this in Lori Garver's book) the Senators complained about all the government-funded jobs that would disappear from their districts with the end of the Shuttle hardware. So, the Senators came up with the Senate Launch System (SLS).

The SLS is an underoptimized rocket for it's task: Landing on the Moon. A single launch lunar landing is absolutely possible with it's 95 Ton LEO Capacity. However, the mass of Orion and its low-deltaV service module prevent this. Under the Constellation Program, the Altair lander would do the Lunar Orbit insertion burn. The Orion CSM is not supposed to get into Lunar Orbit on its own.

The Constellation Architecture is not inherently flawed. But it takes NASA in the wrong direction, as I will explain later.
In contrast, the Artemis Architecture takes a couple parts of Constellation and a few parts of Commerical Space and joins them together in an underoptimized Lunar Program.

At least we get Reusable Lunar Landers out of Artemis.

My prediction for Artemis is the following:
1. The SLS will be cancelled when there is a suitable replacement.
2. These replacement(s) will be derived from the reusable landers.
3. The later Artemis missions will become more and more commercialized.


Artemis is far from the only example of NASA's deep inefficencies.
