It's true that an author will do just about anything to keep your attention, but I am serious about the title of this post.

You must apply the Law of Accelerating Returns to your investment philosophy.

If you bought Tesla stock 10 years ago and held you'd be up 21x  
If you bought Apple stock 10 years ago and held you'd be up 9x  
If you bought Amazon stock 10 years ago and held you'd be up 7x

With this data is it obvious that predicting the next companies to 10x is the best investment strategy.
10% per year in the S&P 500 is fine, 2.6x over 10 years. However, a 25% CAGR with companies that 10x every decade will make you a billionaire. 10x per decade is my target.

Now the question has been reframed.   
It is no longer: "How do I invest." This is obviously a question for dumb people.  
Now the question is: "Which segments will undergo exponential growth over the next 10+ years and which companies will be the winners in those segments."

It is important to start with segments, not companies. Companies are individual entities so they are difficult to predict individually. Entire segments are much larger and thus easier to predict.

The Law of Accelerating Returns and S-curves can be applied to any segment as a method of understanding if that segment will undergo exponential growth.

You must be careful to not over-apply the Law of Accelerating Returns. My first model of global energy production had wind generating 2.7 exa watt-hours in 2100. This is obviously unreasonable. There are limits to growth. These limits must be understood when modelling anything into the future. For mostly finite markets, eg. EVs, S-curves can help in the short term. For infinite markets, eg. energy, you simply must acquire a fundamental understanding of the technology.

The only method I've found for predicting which companies will be the winners in a segment is to extrapolate the future progress of current companies. I have made models of Tesla, SpaceX, RocketLab, and NVIDIA. As opposed to segments, these models require much more thought and effort. I do not have much wisdom to share on this topic right now. This is much more difficult than predicting segments, there is a reason Kurzweil predicted segments and not companies. In the future, I will write a post about how I created these models.

I am making many predictions now so that in 10 years I will understand if I was correct or not. This is the purpose of this blog.

These are my predictions for the future:
1. EV adoption will follow an S-curve and will be greater than 90% of new car sales by 2030.
2. More than 50% of total kilometers driven will be autonomous by 2033.
3. The growth of renewable energy will follow an S-curve.
4. In 2050, solar will be the largest source of energy on Earth. Barring any fusion breakthroughs.
5. Space Applications (eg. Starlink) will grow exponentially long into the future.
6. AI Robot's takeover of labour will follow an S-curve. This will be the largest economic paradigm shift in human history.

A note on fusion: If there is a fusion breakthrough that allows <1 cent per kWh energy generation, its adoption will still follow an S-Curve. Fusion may be a segment to invest in when the S-curve is clearer. Currently, the S-curve of other renewable energy is much clearer and thus can be invested in.

Short-term investing is for idiots, obviously.

Short-term investing is predicting the stock market.  
Long-term investing is predicting the company and the segment.

It is possible to successfully invest short term. But it is much more difficult and less interesting. Do you really want to worry about what the FED will do to interest rates next month? I'd rather model the future of humanity.

The economic pie is not fixed. The economy is growing exponentially.

In 1980, the company will the highest profit was Exxon Mobil with a profit of 4.2 billion dollars.  
In 2000, it was General Motors with a profit of 6 billion dollars.  
In 2022, it was Saudi Aramco at 300 billion dollars. Apple in second place with $122B.

In 2000, Microsoft was the most valuable company at ~400 billion dollars.  
Now, Apple is worth 2.8 Trillion dollars.

This is why you will get 80 Trillion dollars. Extrapolate these exponential trends into the future.

If the investment philosophy laid out above is correct, I will be a billionaire.

One million is only 3 10x's away from one billion. This will take 3 decades from the point where I have one million dollars to become a billionaire. That is a long time, but it is achievable.

you - pronoun  
Used to refer to the person or <i>people</i> that the speaker is addressing.

Kurzweil began the chapter 'The Singularity as Economic Imperative' in The Singularity is Near the same way I began this post. “You will get 80 Trillion dollars just by reading this section and understanding what it says”

You collectively will all get 80+ trillion dollars if you understand this post. Although, depending on how far you look, this number could be orders of magnitude higher.
