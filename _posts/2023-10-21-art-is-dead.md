Bo Burnham wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8WunrI7yh0&list=RDsASBhmBb59I&index=15">Art Is Dead</a> in 2010, well before Netflix-special Bo Burnham existed.

The entire narrative of the song is incorrect.

2. Political Compass test, artists vs engineers
3. Lyrics
4. Comparing 2010 Bo Burnham to Inside Bo Burnham
