# <b>Transition from Privately-Owned ICE vehicles to Autonomous Robotaxis</b>
1. S-curves (show them, and why they're the future) "S-curves are destiny"
2. Personal arguments do not matter, economics does
3. Implications (less car ownership, new auotmotive market decreases, majority of income from software, first mover advantage?, bankruptcies, adjacent technologies, other transport methods that can't compete, clean future)
4. Kurzweil quote about applying paradigms
5. All our problems will be solved through due to economic reasons

1. EV revolution (S-curves, declining costs, Cross over point, Graphs, companies, etc.)
2. Autonomous revolution (Predicting pace of AI, adoption in new vehicles (OEMs), retrofitting, potential first mover advantage, etc.)



The automotive market is currenting undergoing a transition from privately-owned internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to autonomous EV robotaxis. 

There are three components to this transition: ICE to EV, Manual to Autonomous, and Privately-owned vehicles to Robotaxis.

The transition to EVs is easily explained from an economic perspective.  
The transition to autonomy will occur mainly due to leasure and safety reasons from the consumer's perspective.  
The final transition from privately-owned vehicles to robotaxis will occur due to the improved ease of use of Robotaxis.

"S-curves are like gravity" - Tony Seba.  
These transitions can be seen to be as likely as the sun rising tomorrow. Many society-level problems are economics problems, and economic predictions can be immensely accurate.

## <b>EV Revolution</b>

1. S-curves
2. Extrapolating S-curves
3. Fundamental Technologies and their explonential decline in cost
4. EVs are cheaper to own and operate than ICE vehicles
5. Hydrogen (energy efficiency, cost declines?, unnecessary, etc.)
6. Heavy vehicles (buses, trucks, etc.)

#### <b>The EV S-Curve</b>

Currently, the EV revolution is occuring at fervent pace. This is mainly due to economic reasons and is occuring both in personally owned vehicles and commercial/heavy vehicles.

It appears growth in EV adoption has peaked in 2014 and has been sporadically declining since. This is to be expected and is visible in many other <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C5jyyiQzR7RzHMudp3FHdy8RgAwvOLAcO3zKGu-KGOo/edit#gid=254411023?usp=sharing">S-Curves</a>. As any technology matures and the market becomes saturated, growth slowes. The decline in growth is not an indictment of the technology, but rather a sign of its maturity. The decline in growth serves to help identify when the technology will reach its peak market share, which in almost all cases is >99%. 

Above is my prediction for EV market share until 2040, the 50% mark is in 2027 and 90% in 2030.  
This is an economics problem so it can be solved with an economic toolkit. Personal arguments do not apply here, your uncle from Alabama will bregrudingly buy an EV when he realizes how much he'll save, or he'll be in the 1% of people who don't. You can not support major automakers on 1%.

#### <b>Decline in EV Manufacturing Costs</b>

Almost all the major internal components of EVs are declining in cost. 

This is most obvious in battery costs. Batteries have been on a declining cost curve for almost all time. This is due to advancements in materials science, battery chemistry, and economies of scale. 

The cost of EV specific components other than batteries, such as electric motors, will also decrease in cost primarily due to economies of scale. This shows that reaching scale manufacturing of EVs is a key component to success. Speeding up transition plans from ICE to EV is the best strategy.


When taking into account all the declining costs of the underlying components, we are on track for immensely cheap EVs that out perform ICE vehicles in almost every metric. Internal combustion engines are a mature technology; we cannot hope for much more improvement.

The primary consideration when purchasing a vehicle is cost. When EVs are cheaper than all alternatives, what will happen to the alternatives?

#### <b>Further Improvements over ICE</b>

Decreases in purchase price are not the sole reason EVs will succeed. Operating costs, safety, and other peripheral improvements contribute as well.

It's no secret EVs have <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/shopping-advice/a32494027/ev-vs-gas-cheaper-to-own/">lower operating costs</a> than ICE vehicles. Electricity costs vs. gas and less maintenance lead to overall lower operating costs. However, depreciation is a factor that can cause the total cost of ownership to increase, but this is a short term problem. As EVs gain market share due to the other factors EV-specific depreciation will cease being an issue.

The EV architecture is also inherently safer than ICE vehicles for several reasons. The battery pack moves the center of mass lower which lowers the probability of roll-over, the lack of an engine leads to a larger crumple zone, and the lack of combustion <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/study-electric-vehicles-involved-in-fewest-car-fires/">lower probability of fire</a>.

Finally, there are peripheral improvements that effect EVs more than ICE cars. The direct to consumer model leads to a better customer experience and a streamlined purchasing process. This is far more common in the EV space due to the higher risk tolerance and ability to innovate of EV companies. The lack of a dealership also allows for a more direct relationship between the manufacturer and the consumer. This allows for better customer service and a better overall experience. The ease of charging and at home is an improvement for the majority of consumers along with the smoother and quieter ride.

#### <b>Hybrids & Hydrogen Won't Succeed Against EVs</b>

Many products that make sense from an environmental perspective do not work economically when compared to electric vehicles. This can be seen with hybrid and hydrogen vehicles.

Hybrids and Hydrogen cars do not fully benefit from the declining costs of EV technology as these designs are forced to contend with legacy and/or high-cost technology.

Again, this is mainly an economics problem and an engineering or consumer mindset may lead to incorrect conclusions.

The added range and speed of refilling of a Hydrogen vehicle is not enough to offset the cost of the Hydrogen infrastructure. The appeal of Hydrogen cars is relative to the future - mainly economic - appeal of EVs.

Hybrids will not be able to compete with EVs in the long term due to the static costs of the ICE powertrain, the lower maintenance cost of EVs, and decline in purchase price of EVs. Hybrids and EVs may be equal in carbon footprint, but vehicles are not purchases because of how many turtles are saved, vehcile are purchased mainly based on price.

#### <b>Heavy Vehicles</b>

The sources of decreasing cost in personally-owned EVs have vastly greater effects on heavy vehicles. Because of the increased usage of heavy vehicles and the operator's lack of consumer preferences, it is very easy to predict the success of EVs in this segment. Comparing ICE and EV semi-trucks can illustrate this.

As you can see above, EV semi-trucks are currently ~7% cheaper than ICE semis when operating at maximum payload. An EV Semi saves the operator $40k (22%) per year while only decreasing payload by 10,000lb (15%). A 7% cost reduction may appear very marginal, but for large companies like <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazons-electric-delivery-vans-from-rivian">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/08/04/pepsico-explains-uses-tesla-semi-electric-trucks-glimpse-future-of-trucking/">Pepsi</a> this can save hundreds of millions of dollars per year, enough to warrant <a href="https://www.businessandleadership.com/investment/item/jeff-bezos-amazon-rivian-startup/">significant up-front investment</a> in Amazon's case.

Electric semi-trucks must not exceed <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/11682">82,000lb</a> in the US. This maximum is 2,000lb more than ICE as an incentive to EV semi manufacturers. The Tesla Semi is ~10,000lb heavier than an equivalent ICE semi and even with this draw back it is more economical than an equivalent ICE semi. When a semi is not operating at maximum load the cost improvements of EVs are even more pronounced. So, semi's that transport with light loads (volume constrained) EV semis are save more than 7%.

The average cost of a semi-truck is <a href="https://www.durabakcompany.com/blogs/durabak/how-much-does-a-semi-truck-cost">~$150,000</a>. The Tesla Semi costs $150,000 for the 300 mile model and $180,000 for 500 miles of range. This is already near cost parody with ICE Semis, but EV Semi manufacturers are not done yet. Because of the decreasing costs of batteries outlined in earlier sections, EV Semi's will soon be cheaper than ICE equivalents. 

To illustate the potential future cost declines in EV semis, the Tesla Semi's battery is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Semi">~900kWh</a>. At current EV battery pack costs (not cell costs): 900kWh * <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-hit-record-low-of-139-kwh/#:~:text=For%20battery%20electric%20vehicle%20(BEV,of%20the%20total%20pack%20price.">$128/kWh</a> = $115,200. Presumably, Tesla is already below this cost with the 4680 cells. If battery costs decline 80% is the next 10 years <a href="https://tonyseba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RethinkingEnergy2020-2030-LRR.pdf">(page 8)</a>, the cost to produce an electric semi may fall by more than 2x.

Not only the cost to produce electric semi's is decreasing, but also fuel costs. The average price of electricity in the US is $0.16/kWh. Current solar installations can produce electricity for <a href="https://www.solar.com/learn/solar-panel-cost/">6-8 cents</a> per kWh. As sustainable energy generation sources further decrease in cost and increase in production, electricity prices will fall.

For niche applications, electric semi's are not yet ready to compete with ICE semis. For exmaple, in <a href="https://www.energysage.com/local-data/electricity-cost/ca/san-diego-county/san-diego/#:~:text=Electric%20rates%20in%20San%20Diego%2C%20CA,-The%20easiest%20way&text=The%20average%20residential%20electricity%20rate,rate%20of%2019%20%C2%A2%2FkWh.">some metro areas</a> electricity prices are absurdly high. When electricity prices are 3x the national average, electric semi's are not economical. So, if a semi's job is to offload containers from a port in a metro area, it is not ideal to use an EV semi in a poorly managed city with high electricity prices. Also, if a semi must travel >500 miles without stopping for 30 minutes to charge or it is carrying an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgX7N2-dC9A">areodynamically inefficient payload</a>, EV semis are not yet competitive with ICE.

The range of EV semi's is not a major concern. Truck drivers drive <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/e/How-Many-Miles-Is-a-Truck-Driver-Allowed-to-Drive-in-one-Day#:~:text=If%20a%20truck%20driver%20adheres,%2C%20traffic%2C%20and%20weather%20conditions.">605-650 miles per day</a> on average. This may require 2-3 stops to charge. If an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz7TyZ8wNYg">efficient route</a> is used, this may only delay the delivery by ~1 hour.

Semi trucks are not the only heavy vehicles that will transition to EVs as vehicles that often travel short trips are ripe for transition to EV. <a href="https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/first-electric-fire-engine-in-canada-dec-2023.aspx">Firetrucks</a> often only serve their local area, no more than 10km in diameter. Furthermore, Buses can charge in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2022/12/08/teslas-new-semi-truck-will-be-great-if-you-get-your-electricity-wisely/?sh=26e6b8042b5a">5-10 minutes</a> depending on route length and battery size, short enough to charge while waiting for passangers at a home station.

### <b>Autonomous Revolution</b>

The autonomus part of this revolution is currently occuring at a slower pace than the transition to EVs. At any given moment there are <10,000 autonomous vehicles (AVs) driving on roads, even at the most quite hour of night there are many orders of magnitude more EVs driving. This is due to the fact that the AV S-curve is 5-10 years behind the EV revolution. S-curve growth peaks at around  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSFc0gy2LnJKCwSEu2trwpLwnUNQqv1Y0znnX72tie8/edit?usp=sharing">5% - 10% market share</a>. AVs are not yet at a point for clear exponential growth while EVs are.
