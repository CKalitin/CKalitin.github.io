Takeaways:
1. Existing Rideshareable missions are early electron launches, tech demos to unique orbots (except ALE-2), and rideshare (Astra, Vega)
2. Only 3 missions (Palisade com sat demo, GMS-T com sat, baby come back rideshare with NASA, demo, and spire weather sats) were over 1000km, still addressable by Mira
3. The remiaining Kickstagable satellite are in slightly unique SSO orbits for imaging/SAR (750km GAzella, 350km CE-SAT IIB w/ Doves)
4. Firefly quick response military launch is not addressable by rideshare
5. The mission to low inclinations are Synthetic Aperture Radar, Imaging, Observation these are difficult to address due to the unique orbital planes with constellations (tropics, Blackstar Global, Capella)

Categories:
1. Rideshareable
3. SSO Kick stage
4. Low inclination constellation (Unique orbital plane required)
5. Military

Other:
* Planet Labs has had 4 flights, the first 2 electrons, and two electrons in 2020 for super doves one of which failed, super doves have also been launched on PSLV
* The imaging launches are all Blacksky & PlanetLabs
* Kick Stages are a high-level technology that decreases costs slightly
* Include an estimate of cost

Cost:
* Mira is 250kg wet mass + 300kg payload with 500m/s
* Transporter missions are ~$5,500 / kg, $3M launch cost
* Assume $1-2M cost when at scale
* This is slightly lower than an electron (~7M) and easier to bring down in the future
* SpaceX's cross launch margins are >50%, Rocket Lab is ~20%
* More room for cost declines on an MLV, could get 2x cheaper in the short term
* Recovery could bring down Electron costs by ~1-2 million, bridging the gap
* Either way, the only advantage of dedicated small sat launch for a mission that could take a Mira is schedule

In the last 5 years Rocket Lab's Electron dedicated small satellite launches and SpaceX's Transporter rideshare missions have become regular occurances. This has posed a problem many have stugguled to answer by my standards: Why would any satellites be launched on a small rocket when rideshare missions are cheaper?

First, we must understand the categories of small satellites. 

### Rideshareable Satellites

+ Planet Labs launches example

In the past 5 years (2018-2023), 31 dedicated small sat launches have occured. By my criteria, 10 of these missions could have been completed through launching on a rideshare mission.

These missions are (Rocket, Payload):
1. Electron - Dove/Lemurs
2. Electron - CICERO 10/Lemurs
3. Electron - ALE-2
4. Vega     - Small Sat Rideshare
5. Electron - Dragracer/BRO/SpaceBEE
6. Electron - Strix-Alpha
7. Electron - Strix-Beta
8. Rocket 3 - Small Sat Rideshare
9. Electron - E-Space Demo
10. Alpha   - Small Sat Rideshare
