SpaceX's Bandwagon-1 rideshare mission is set to launch tomorrow on April 7th 2024 at 10:16 pm PST. This is the first of SpaceX's rideshare missions to low inclination orbits. SpaceX's previous Transporter missions have all gone to Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO) which are ideal for Earth Observation satellites. The Bandwagon-1 mission will expand the range of payloads that can be launched on a Falcon 9 rideshare mission and will continue the trend of making dedicated small satellite launch a smaller niche of the market. While dedicated small satellite launch will lose market share, the overall market will increase and provide more satellites that must be launched.



New Structure:
1. Introduction
2. Payload list and compare to my previous blog post
3. List payloads that make sense in my previous predictions
4. Go into constellations that don't need exact orbital planes and why I was wrong
5. Future of the market (Rideshare is cheaper and a commercial inevitability (SpaceX isn't malicious), earth coverage constellations, other constellations, expediency)

### <b>Competition between Alpha and Electron</b>

* Compare payloads to earlier Transporter missions
* Compare to small sat missions
* Predict which small sat payloads will fly on these types of missions
* Long-term outlook on small launch

More notes:
* The reason I was off the mark was only looking at electron payloads, not payloads in general - Expand to talk about Rocket Lab "analysts" that focus too much on the company and too little on the overall market, this is a surefire way to be wrong, bad strats
* I didn't fully appriciate how many small constellations don't need exact orbits (Spire, Capella, Hawk, Blacksky somewhat)
* Constellations that don't need exact orbits examples: (NASA Prefire (Tropics too), Strix), large sats like Strix or constellations that need regular coverage like Tropics

"On board this mission are 11 spacecraft including KOREA's 425Sat, HawkEye 360’s Clusters 8 & 9, Tyvak International’s CENTAURI-6, iQPS’s QPS-SAR-7 TSUKUYOMI-II, Capella Space’s Capella-14, and Tata Advanced Systems Limited’s TSAT-1A."

Payloads that I predicted:
1. Korea 425 - first one launched on a Falcon 9 on Dec 1 2023, 23 secondary payloads (a couple 150kg, ION SCV012, Bane, most small sats), 800kg
https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/425-project-sar.htm
2. CENTAURI-6, internet of things connectivity satellite 12kg, 6U, ridesharable, previously flew on a PSLV, SSO-A Falcon 9 rideshare, Electron rideshare and 2 transporter flights
3. TSAT-1A, Tech demo Earth observation satellite from india

Incorrect predictions:
1. HawkEye 360, they've done 6 flights on transporter missions in the past and 1 electron, 2 electrons coming up. 
I miscategorized this in the previous blog post, they're ridesharable payloads, the electron launch was to a lower inclination, appears to be agnostic to inclincation or an exact orbit.
Also, these aren't Earth Observation but RF  signal location satellites, finding other RF signals in space are commercial use.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HawkEye_360
2. iQPS's QPS-SAR-7 TSUKUYOMI-II, some SAR satellites can fly on rideshare missions, 2 on Epsilon, one previously flew on electron, 1 transporter in 2023
Exact orbits not required due to the small size of the constellation
https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/qps-sar-3.htm
3. Capella. They previously flew on Electron and Transporter missions, rideshare on starlink flight too, completely missed the mark on this one.
The electron flights were to lower inclinations, possibly to cover more important areas of the Earth's surface, Didn't target lowest possible inclination from virginia
Now these bandwagon missions may fit their requirements, better to be on lower inclinations
Again, small number of satellites and no requirement for full global coverage at lowest possible time between passes
