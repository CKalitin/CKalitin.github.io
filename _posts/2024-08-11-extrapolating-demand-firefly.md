Tell me where I'm wrong or just give compliments <a href="https://x.com/CKalitin/status/1813437503480696867">fix me pls</a>.

"Our view of 1-ton is it's kind of a no man's land because if you look at Electron it's been increadibly successful. If you look at the paylaods that we're lifting they're all sort of in that 200 kg class, so the whole reason someone comes to a dedicated rocket is because they want a dedicated rocket. So putting a 200 kg payload in a one ton lift class, I just don't see how you can be economic to be able to compete with a smaller 300 kg lift class."

"It's too small to be a useful rideshare vehicle and it's too big to be a decicated vehicle."

Today 4 of the best space investing Youtubers posted their interview with Peter Beck and Adam Spice of Rocket Lab. Responding to <a href="https://youtu.be/dfIHhLd9Wjs?si=tTmpJ1NQNpwMN2hB&t=379">one of Dave G's questions</a>, Peter Beck said this about the 1-ton rocket class: "Our view of 1-ton is it's kind of a no mans land."

Over this year I've written a few blog posts on the topic of the 1-ton lift class. <a href="https://ckalitin.github.io/technology/2024/02/16/firefly-vs-rocketlab.html">1</a>, <a href="https://ckalitin.github.io/space/2024/07/04/small-sat-constellations.html">2</a>, <a href="https://ckalitin.github.io/space/2024/07/16/small-constellation-charts.html">3</a>. The primary insights from this reasearch have been that there is little competition between the 1-ton and ~300 kg classes and that there only a very small niche of the constellation market that is optimal for the 1-ton class. Peter Beck's comments help to confirm my conclusions.

In this blog post, I'll use my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOgRbnAsQZdGIPoemRj5ApSLk_jxGanNliWEPnBB3p4/edit?usp=sharing">dataset</a> (Based on Jonathan Mcdowell's public data, Gunter's Space Page, and others) to quantify exactly how big the market for the 1-ton class rockets is.
