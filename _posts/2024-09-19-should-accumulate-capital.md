Notes:
1. What Money Is
 * This blog post isn't "Why you should be rich"
 * When most people think about money, they think about buying power
 * Money is used to purchase goods and services
2. What Capital Is
 * Unlike money, capital is allocated, not spent
 * Capital allows you to participate in the debate over the future of humanity
 * Capital is power over the future
 * Capital is accumulated
 * Capital is used to make more capital
3. Capital As Power
 * This gets to the ideals of democracy, it's pay to play in terms of time, intelligence, and focus
 * Capitalism spreads power among the rich and the politicians, this is why capitalism wins over communism, distribution of power
 * Distribution of power is democracy, so a wide distribution of capital is synonymous with democracy (don't confuse this with equality of outcome, equity isn't evenly distributed)
 * One of the issues with democracy is you have even say in all issues
 * With capital you can focus all your power in a particular field, far more efficient - and you decide to enter the game
4. Conclusion
 * This blog came from the sauna and thinking about kids and my impact on the future
 * Buying power (money) is shared with my wife, capital is mine
 * How you accumulate capital is left as an exercise to the reader
 * this is just the why and what to do once you have it
 * Capital as a method of increasing the prosperity of humanity can be debated (Blue Origin vs. SpaceX)
