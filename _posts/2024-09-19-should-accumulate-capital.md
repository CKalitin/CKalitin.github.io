1. What Money Is
 * This blog post isn't "Why you should be rich"
 * When most people think about money, they think about buying power
 * Money is used to purchase goods and services
2. What Capital Is
 * Unlike money, capital is allocated, not spent
 * Capital is accumulated
 * Capital is used to make more capital
3. Capital As Power
 * Capital is power over the future
 * Capital allows you to participate in the debate over the future of humanity
 * This gets to the ideals of democracy, it's pay to play in terms of time, intelligence, and focus
 * Capitalism spreads power among the rich and the politicians, this is why capitalism wins over communism, distribution of power
 * Distribution of power is democracy, so a wide distribution of capital is synonymous with democracy (don't confuse this with equality of outcome, equity isn't evenly distributed)
 * One of the issues with democracy is you have even say in all issues
 * With capital you can focus all your power in a particular field, far more efficient - and you decide to enter the game
4. Conclusion
 * This blog came from the sauna and thinking about kids and my impact on the future
 * Buying power (money) is shared with my wife, capital is mine
 * How you accumulate capital is left as an exercise to the reader, this is just the why and what to do once you have capital
 * Capital vs. Time & Genius as a method of increasing the prosperity of humanity can be debated (Blue Origin vs. SpaceX)
 * If you just listen to economists for dozens of hours, you'll learn economics through osmosis

### <b>What Money Is</b>

This blog post is not "Why You Should Be Rich." When most people think about being rich the first thing that comes to mind is buying power. "I want to win the lottery so I can live on a yacht with a Lamborgini and an expensive watch." This is fundamentally spending your money to purchase goods and services - you do not get this spent money back. This spending is used to increase your quality of life or for other mainly hedonistic reasons. 

Many self-made millionaire types (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GrahamStephan">Real estate brokers</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThachNguyen">builders</a>, <a href="https://sweatystartup.com/businesses-i-love/">sweaty startup founders</a>, etc.) often call this hedonistic spending "burning capital." The transactions described above are not net positives for your bank balance. You spend money to recieve goods that depreciate or for services that are consumed. For the purposes of this blog post, I will use this colloquial definition of money.

Fundamentally, prices are a mechanism for the allocation of scarce resources. You spend money to purchase these scarce goods/services. This basic economic principle is why spending money is a net negative for your bank balance. 

For this next section it's useful to temporarily remove the word money from your vocabulary. We need to solve the problem of allocating scarce resources. You require food, shelter, a mate, etc. to live and all these resources are scarce. This poses the problem of how best to allocate these resources to individuals. Capitalism (<i>there's a more fundamental term here</i>) is the principle of earning the right to scarce resources through providing value. You provide value through your work and are paid in currency that can be exchanged for resources. In feudal times, you could work to produce wheat which is exchanged for other goods and services or given to your lord for the right to produce more wheat. Our modern economic system uses money as a measurement of both produced and consumed value. For this reason, in edge cases it is possible to gain the right to scarce resources (eg. winning the lottery) without providing value (ie. working).

### <b>What Capital Is</b>

Money is an input into production processes. Just like all the other inputs - people, materials, land, etc. - it is consumed. However, the most important difference between money and other resources is that money is both an input and an output of all production processes. Unlike wood or steel, money doesn't contitute any physical object because money is a measurement of value. You cannot recoup the exact wood and steel that were used to build a factory, but you can recoup the exact money that was used to purchase those materials because every dollar is the same as every other dollar - dollars are measurements, not anything physical.

Because money is fundamentally both an input and output, you don't need to consider it in the same way we consider other inputs. The most important element of capital is that it can gain value over time. Unlike money - which is spent and never returns to your bank account (mostly) - allocated capital can turn into more capital. An investor can put  capital into a project and receive more capital in return - they recieve the same exact resource they put in. This is not also true of lumber because lumber is consumed and not used as a currency. Fundamentally, money is spent on goods and services while capital is used to make more capital. Unlike money, capital is allocated, not spent. Put more simply, capital is money that turns into more money over time.

Capital is fundamentally productive because each production step adds value. If this isn't true, there is a negative return on invested capital. For any production done in a competitive free market, the value of the output must be greater than the value of the inputs. This is an axiom that applies to all production. If this axiom isn't satisfied, the market quickly corrects itself and either the producer adapts or goes bankrupt.

It should be clear why capital is more useful than money from the perspective of individuals (using the colloquial definitions as described above). Capital makes more of itself and can be converted into money at any time by making purchases. This is fundamentally why investing works. Instead of spending your entire paycheque, you can invest in the S&P 500 and bet on the absolute productivity of those 500 companies increasing. Later, you can withdraw your capital and spend it on more goods and services than you could have purchased otherwise.
