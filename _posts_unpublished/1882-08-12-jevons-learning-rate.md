### <b>Prelude</b>

Just head to the introduction section, it's not an issue if you skip this section. Remember that your parent's expect you to be the kind of busy, productive person that skips these kinds of personal prelude sections in blog posts!!

A few days ago I was sitting in my honours integral calculus class and my brain was far too small to understand the subject matter. So, I had the epiphany that Jevon's Paradox can be described using the framework of learning rate. Naturally, instead of spending the next 15 minutes learning trig substitution, I jotted down the notes you see above.

I first heard of Jevon's Paradox from Github Copilot when I was writing some notes on a blog post idea entitled Second and Third Order Effects of Increasing Energy Use. This idea came to me while reading The Capitalist Manifesto, so you might be able to guess at what my take would be. I write all my blog posts in VS Code as .md files, so Copilot is always trying to complete my sentences. Sometimes, it gives me a great topic to cover like Jevon's Paradox in the context of one of my existing ideas! Since then, Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, <a href="https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1883753899255046301">posted about Jevon's Paradox</a> in the context of Deepseek supposedly demonstrating greater efficiency in AI training. 

### <b>Introduction</b>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevon's Paradox</a> is the observation that when technological advancements make a production process more efficient, instead of decreased resource usage (as you'd expect), the usage of that resource increases. Essentially, with more efficient methods of utilizing resources, we actually end up using more resources, not less.

<i>Above is a chart that shows my prediction for EV market share. This prediction applies the principle of learning rate to predict the future of the car market.</i>

In a previous blog post, <a href="https://ckalitin.github.io/technology/2024/11/19/s-curve-examples.html">S-Curves Allow You to Predict the Future</a>, I showed how the framework of learning rate can be applied to predict the future. In short, all technologies follow the same pattern of cost decline and demand increase. This pattern is followed so regularly that you can use it to predict certain products/markets into the future with high accuracy. The S-Curve is the graphical representation of this principle, which you can see above or in my previous blog post. In the most basic sense, you can just fit an S-Curve to existing market data, and extrapolate into the future (so long as you check your assumptions carefully!).

The framework of applying Learning Rate is the fundamental principle that allows me to have high certainty in my predictions. Learning Rate is the percentage cost decline for a cumulative doubling in production. For example, <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/29/battery-costs-have-fallen-97-since-1991-claim-mit-researchers/">batteries</a> currently have a learning rate of about 20%, meaning for every doubling in production (about every 2 years) they fall in cost by about 20%. Casey Handmer explains part of the concept in <a href="https://youtu.be/ekEdq6PhC0Q?si=Verot8watOdSoCzD&t=551">this clip</a>.
