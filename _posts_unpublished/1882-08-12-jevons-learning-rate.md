### <b>Introduction</b>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons Paradox</a> is the observation that when technological advancements make a production process more efficient, instead of decreased resource usage (as you'd expect), the usage of that resource increases. Essentially, with more efficient methods of utilizing resources, we actually end up using more resources, not less.

<i>Above is a chart that shows my prediction for EV market share. This prediction applies the principle of learning rate to predict the future of the car market.</i>

In a previous blog post, <a href="https://ckalitin.github.io/technology/2024/11/19/s-curve-examples.html">S-Curves Allow You to Predict the Future</a>, I showed how the framework of learning rate can be applied to predict the future. In short, all technologies follow the same pattern of cost decline and demand increase. This pattern is followed so regularly that you can use it to predict certain products/markets into the future with high accuracy. The S-Curve is the graphical representation of this principle, which you can see above or in my previous blog post. In the most basic sense, you can just fit an S-Curve to existing market data, and extrapolate into the future (so long as you check your assumptions carefully!).

The framework of applying Learning Rate is the fundamental principle that allows me to have high certainty in my predictions. Learning Rate is the percentage cost decline for a cumulative doubling in production. For example, <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/29/battery-costs-have-fallen-97-since-1991-claim-mit-researchers/">batteries</a> currently have a learning rate of about 20%, meaning for every doubling in production (about every 2 years) they fall in cost by about 20%. Casey Handmer explains part of the concept in <a href="https://youtu.be/ekEdq6PhC0Q?si=Verot8watOdSoCzD&t=551">this clip</a>.

### <b>Jevons Paradox is a Subset of the Principle Behind Learning Rate</b>

<i>Super simple diagram that shows the principle behind learning rate.</i>

Energy and Civilization notes:
"In countries with high per capita energy use, “at saturation”, Jevons paradox is weaker."

Notes:

- CLD
- Jevons Paradox is a subset of the principle behind learning rate
- Note the delayed effect
- Handmer quote, marginal increase...

### <b>Further Fundamental Questions</b>

- Note stauration for future reserach
- Now why does more prod = greater efficiency? Future research, very fundamental question
- R&D can't be predicted, too low level for Psychohistory (economics)

### <b>Anecdotes</b>

<i>(<a href="{{site.url}}/assets/images/jevons-learning-rate/notebook.jpg">Expanded Image</a>) These are my notes from math class.</i>

A few days ago I was sitting in my honours integral calculus class and my brain was far too small to understand the subject matter. So, I had the epiphany that Jevons Paradox can be described using the framework of learning rate. Naturally, instead of spending the next 15 minutes learning trig substitution, I jotted down the notes you see above.

<i>This is the <a href="https://github.com/CKalitin/ckalitin.github.io/commit/b829dd56f774547c1bf48911ccfffa265ebaf28f">commit</a> where Copilot told me about Jevons Paradox. Oct 27 2024.</i>

I first heard of Jevons Paradox from Github Copilot when I was writing some notes on a blog post idea entitled Second and Third Order Effects of Increasing Energy Use. This idea came to me while reading The Capitalist Manifesto, so you might be able to guess at what my take would be. I write all my blog posts in VS Code as .md files, so Copilot is always trying to complete my sentences. Sometimes, it gives me a great topic to cover like Jevons Paradox in the context of one of my existing ideas!

Since then, Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, <a href="https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1883753899255046301">posted about Jevons Paradox</a> in the context of Deepseek supposedly demonstrating greater efficiency in AI training.

<i>Excerpt from Page 14 of Energy and Civilization.</i>

I once again heard about Jevons Paradox while reading <a href="https://x.com/pronounced_kyle/status/1865939460468441314">Energy and Civilization</a>. This is one of the great books that takes a very high level idea ("energy") and connects it down to extremely low level phenomena. The Alchemy of Air is another amazing example. One great anecdote from Energy and Civilization comes from a description of early attempts at harnessing a fraction of the kinetic energies of wind and water. These same energy flows steered the great late fifteenth-century European transatlantic voyages to the Caribbean, instead of farther north. The same energy flows that allowed us to lower the cost of processing grain steered Columbus to the Caribbean!
