A few days ago I was sitting in my honours integral calculus class and my brain was far too small to understand the subject matter. So, I had the epiphany that Jevon's Paradox can be described using the frame of learning rate. Instead of spending 15 minutes learning trig substitution, I jotted down the notes you see above.

My previous blog post, <a href="https://ckalitin.github.io/technology/2024/11/19/s-curve-examples.html">S-Curves Allow You to Predict the Future</a>, showed how the framework of learning rate can be applied to predict the future. In short, all technologies follow the same pattern of cost decline and demand increase, and this is regular enough that you can use it to predict certain products/markets with high accuracy into the future. 

The fundamental principle that allows for this accurate prediction is learning rate. Learning Rate is the percentage cost decline for a cumulative doubling in production. For example, <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/03/29/battery-costs-have-fallen-97-since-1991-claim-mit-researchers/">batteries</a> currently have learning rate of about 20%, meaning for every doubling in production (about every 2 years) they fall in cost by about 20%. Casey Handmer explains part of the concept in <a href="https://youtu.be/ekEdq6PhC0Q?si=Verot8watOdSoCzD&t=551">this clip</a>.
